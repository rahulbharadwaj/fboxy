<p><b>Pedro Afonso (1848–1850) was the Prince Imperial and heir apparent to the throne of the Empire of Brazil.</b></p>

Pedro Afonso was seen as vital to the future viability of the monarchy, which had been put in jeopardy by the death of his older brother Afonso almost three years earlier. Pedro Afonso's early death from fever at the age of one devastated the Emperor, and the imperial couple had no further children.</p>
